#CHIP-8 Emulator

My first attempt at an emulator, used primarily as a learning exercise to better understand how a basic CPU may read instructions

Afterwards may move towards a more advanced emulation project such as the NES.

In its current state it can run any ROM which does not rely on EX or FX instructions...
So pretty much anything that doesn't take user input

I will implement the EX - FX Opcodes shortly
